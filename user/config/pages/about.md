## About this demonstration atlas

This atlas is purely for demonstrating the *Configurable Atlas project* from the UKCEH Biological Records Centre (BRC). The atlas was made by forking the BRC repository (https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/configurable-atlas) into my own GitHub account (https://github.com/burkmarr/middlesex-earthworms) and following the instructions given in the repo for generating atlas data from a CSV of biological records and configuring the atlas website.

### Image gallery

To demonstrate the image gallery I included just a few pictures which means that for most taxa, you won't see any pictures. The taxa that have pictures are:
- Aporrectodea caliginosa
- Aporrectodea rosea
- Aporrectodea longa
